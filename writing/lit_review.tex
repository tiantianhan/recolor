\section{Related studies}

%intro: relevant prior work fall into four rough categories. There is a large body of work on the subject of general automatic colour transfer and colour grading by example, transfering the "style" or specific colours in an example image to another image. There have been several prior attempts at transfering specifically images wherein skin colour is prominent, and these we will discuss in detail. There are also several examples of practical application of skin transfer algorithms, where different application demonstrate practical uses of usually relatively simple skin transfer algorithm that is part of a larger project, we will discuss several of these projects. Finally, there is the field of skintone enhancement software, where algorithms are usually intended to adjust the user skin colour towards a more pleasing tone and not to a specific target colour. We include the latter because unlike the other categories of prior work there are several studies of adjusting skintone on a mobile device, which is part of the requirements for this project.
